# Cheminformatic Utils Web Services

In addition to the described data-focused web services, a utility web service that provides RESTful access to commonly used cheminformatic methods has been released. These web services have been developed under the name **'ChEMBL Beaker'** and provide users with access chemical property calculators \(e.g. molecular weight\), structure format converters \(e.g. molfile to SMILES\) and a structure standardiser. The methods being exposed by this service are providing RESTful interface to the [RDKit cheminformatics library](http://www.rdkit.org/). These services also provide access to methods that extract chemical information from images. The [OSRA library](http://cactus.nci.nih.gov/osra/) is used to expose this functionality. [Online documentation is available.](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/utils/docs)
