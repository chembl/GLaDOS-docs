# ChEMBL Data Questions

### How often do you update the data?

The data is updated regularly, with releases approximately every 3-4 months.

### Can you provide of list of all changes and additions you've made since the last release?

We provide a list of all downgraded compounds with each release. However, it would be impossible to note all structural changes and/or changes to compound names etc. If there is something specific that you need to check, please contact us and we will be able to let you know what, if anything, has happened to that compound.
