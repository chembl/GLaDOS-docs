# General Questions

## What is the ChEMBLID?

The ChEMBLID is a unique ID that has been assigned to compounds, targets, assays, documents, tissues and cell types in ChEMBL. It can be used to retrieve a Report Card page for these entities, or to search for them using the keyword search.

## What is the Assay Type?

* Binding \(B\) - Data measuring binding of compound to a molecular target, e.g. Ki, IC50, Kd.
* Functional \(F\) - Data measuring the biological effect of a compound, e.g. %cell death in a cell line, rat weight.
* ADMET \(A\) - ADME data e.g. t1/2, oral bioavailability.
* Toxicity \(T\) - Data measuring toxicity of a compound, e.g., cytotoxicity.
* Physicochemical \(P\) - Assays measuring physicochemical properties of the compounds in the absence of biological material e.g., chemical stability, solubility.
* Unclassified \(U\) - A small proportion of assays cannot be classified into one of the above categories e.g., ratio of binding vs efficacy.

How can I cite ChEMBL in a publication?

## The publications used to cite ChEMBL are:

**ChEMBL Database:**

## How do I report errors or make suggestions for the interface?

1. We have a dedicated email address for data queries, error reporting or help requests. This is: [chembl-help@ebi.ac.uk](mailto:chembl-help@ebi.ac.uk)
2. You can [create an issue](https://github.com/chembl/GLaDOS/issues/new) in our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/chembl/GLaDOS).

## What is the difference between Molregno and ChEMBLID?

Molregno is our ChEMBL internal identification given to each compound. The ChEMBLID is the externally viewed identification for each compound.

## What is the best way to access large amounts of data in ChEMBL?

The best way to access large amounts of data is to install a database instance on your own computer using Oracle or MySQL.

## Is there a ChEMBL RDF?

Yes, there is a ChEMBL RDF. It is stored on the FTP site.

## Why do Assays and Documents both have ChEMBLIDs?

ChEMBLIDs are assigned to targets, assays, documents, tissues, cell types and compounds in ChEMBL and they are used as the unique identifiers for each.

## What is the difference between the different releases of ChEMBLdb, e.g. ChEMBL\_14 and ChEMBL\_15?

ChEMBL\_14 is an earlier release of the data, with ChEMBL\_15 being an updated version. Subsequent updates will have consecutive numbers, so the one with the highest number will be the most recent full version of the data.

## How do you use the Web Services?
