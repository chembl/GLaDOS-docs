# New Web Interface

We have developed a new [web interface](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/beta/) that will eventually replace the [current one](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) completely. It is still in a beta stage, this means that it provides all the mayor features, but it is expected to have some known and unknown bugs. We will be working on fixing them as a next stage.

## New Features

### Free Text Search

* The bar will provide some suggestions as you write on the bar. 
* You don't need to click on a different button to search for different entity types anymore \(Compounds, Targets, Assays, Documents, Cells or Tissues\), the interface will search among all entities for you. 
* The search bar now appears in all the pages, including report cards, so you don't have to go back to the main page to search for another term. 
* Our new interface uses elasticsearch indexes, you can use a DSL to build complex queries, see our [guide](searching-guide.md). 

### Structure Search

 - You can search by using the [Marvin JS sketcher](https://chemaxon.com/products/marvin-js). You can open it just by clicking on the "structure" icon on the search bar:
